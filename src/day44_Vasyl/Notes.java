	/*let's do some quick review:

	Objcet - it's an instance of class.
	Class - is a blueprint/template for object. 
		fields/variables
		- instance variables
		- define properties of object
		- static variable (variable that belongs to the class)
		we will talk tomorrow about static

	public, protected, default (no name!), private --> they are access modifiers!
		
		class Student{
			// instance variable (must be non-static!)
			//since this variable is private
			//we cannot access it outside of this class
			private String name;

			//this is instance method
			public void setName(String name){
				this.name = name // this is how we define property
			}
			//when we don't have any access modifier, that means this method/variable has default access modifer.
			
			//this is instance method
			String getName(){
				return name;
			}

		}

		class StudentTester{
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Student student1 = new Student();
				student1.setName("Ali");

			}
		}
	we call setter method "mutator". That means we use this method in order to modify instane variable.

	 methods
	 	instance methods (they are non-static)
	 	For example: 
	 		//this is instance method
			public String getName(){
				return name;
			}
			Same methods in terms of functionality. 
			Why? because they return name.
			Only thing is that they have different access level.
			String getName(){
				return name;
			}

	//Object -> it's a class. Root class of all classes.
		we use instance method in order to manipulate with instance variables.
	private - visible only inside a class.
	default(there is no keyword, no access modifier) - visible only in the package
	protected - same as default, unless inherited.
	public - visible everywhere! 

	one more thing about instance methods: we can use the obly if we will create an object.

	Class object = new Class();
	object.method();

	str.trim(); -> instance method that is coming from String.

	Class.method() --> illegal for instance methods, but works for static methods.

	static methods/variables - we can access with class name (this action is not possible with instance memebers(non-static variables or methods.))

	Class.staticMethod();
	for example:
	Arrays.toString(arr);
