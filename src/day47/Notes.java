/*Static VS instance



	
Static belong to the class
	We can access static members using static way
	classNmae.fieldName
	ClassName.methodName(args..)	
	Static field	
	There is only one copy of static field value
	Shared among entire object created out of class
	
	Can we access static members using object
	
	YES BUT HIGHLY DISCOURAGED !
	Obj.sataticFiled
	Obj.staticMethod(args)
	Even eclipse will show warning to remind you to access static members in static way
	
	Instance belong to the object
	An object must be created to access instance members
	Obj.filedName
	Obj.methodName(args..)
	
	THIS IS NOT ALLOWED!!!
	ClassName.insatnceField
	
	Instance members VS static members Access
