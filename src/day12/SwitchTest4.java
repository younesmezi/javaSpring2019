//Task 4
/*
 * Switch VS Ternary VS if else
 * 
 * Switch : should be used when checking for equality of certain
 * variable in multiple specific case Ternary : conditionally assigning
 * a value . we can not take actions we can only assign value according
 * to condition If else : most flexible , can do anything
 * 
 * use switch statement to accomplish this task
 * 
 * declare a int variable dayNum declare a String variable dayWord
 * 
 * use switch to check for equality of dayNum case 1 --- assign the
 * value for dayWord as Monday : dayWord = "Monday" ; case 2 --- assign
 * the value for dayWord as Tuesday case 3 --- assign the value for
 * dayWord as Wednesday case 4 --- assign the value for dayWord as
 * Thursday case 5 --- assign the value for dayWord as Friday case 6 ---
 * assign the value for dayWord as Saturday case 7 --- assign the value
 * for dayWord as Sunday
 * 
 * if nothing match assign value dayWord as invalid day
 * 
 * after switch statement -- print out the dayWord value
 *
